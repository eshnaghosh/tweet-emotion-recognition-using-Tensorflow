# Tweet emotion recognition using Tensorflow (by Cousera)

In this project, we created a recurrent neural network and trained it on a tweet emotion dataset to learn to recognize emotions in tweets. The dataset has thousands of tweets each classified in one of 6 emotions. This is a multi class classification problem in the natural language processing domain. We used TensorFlow as our machine learning framework.
# Behaviour
In this project, we are going to create a recurrent neural network or RNN and train it on a tweet emotion dataset (Tweet Emotion Dataset) to learn to recognize emotions in tweets. The dataset has thousands of tweets each classified in one of 6 emotions. This is a multiclass classification problem in the natural language processing domain. We will be using TensorFlow as our machine learning framework.
